## About Drevesnik

Drevesnik is an online application designed for querying dependency-parsed corpora in Slovenian. Its primary goal is to assist researchers in exploring various kinds of grammatical phenomena, from lexical analysis to morphology and syntax. The process begins with the user entering a [query](https://orodja.cjvt.si/drevesnik/help/en) and selecting the desired corpora. Results are then displayed as dependency trees (graphs) and are available for download for more in-depth analysis.

All corpora are annotated following the cross-lingually harmonized [Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org) (UD) annotation scheme. Detailed information about the categories and guidelines for their application to Slovenian texts is available in  [Slovenian UD guidelines](https://wiki.cjvt.si/books/07-universal-dependencies).

The interface is based on the open-source [dep_search](https://github.com/TurkuNLP/dep_search) tool, developed by the University of Turku, which was localized and further developed with the support of the CLARIN.SI research infrastructure (2019 CLARIN.SI Projects) and the Slovenian Research and Innovation Agency ([SPOT](https://spot.ff.uni-lj.si/) Z6-4617, PJVT P6-0411). 

The code is freely available on the [CLARIN.SI repository](https://github.com/clarinsi/drevesnik).
