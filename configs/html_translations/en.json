After typing in the query and selecting the corpora of interest, the results are shown in the form of dependency trees (graphs) and can also be downloaded for further analysis.<br><br>All corpora are annotated using the <a href=\"https://universaldependencies.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Universal Dependencies</a> annotation scheme, with more information on the categories and the guidelines available on the project website. The query language is explained on a separate <a href=\"/drevesnik/help/en\" target=\"_blank\">help page</a>, which also includes links to demo queries. <br><br>The interface is based on the open-source <a href=\"https://github.com/TurkuNLP/dep_search\" target=\"_blank\">dep_search</a> tool, developed by the University of Turku, which was localized and further developed with the support of the CLARIN.SI research infrastructure and the Slovenian Research Agency.
